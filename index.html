            When you hear about metabolism, you will often hear about physical activity and even bodybuilding. So what is the relationship between all this?

First, let's get back to the metabolism. This is the whole process of transforming food into energy. We can distinguish low metabolism, which is actually the minimum energy that our body needs to keep our vital organs at rest.

To feed this basic metabolism, it is necessary that your body records a minimum of calories. Although it is difficult to establish an average common to all, because this basic metabolism is a function of your age, your sex, but also your current weight and even your degree of sedentarity.

Let's say that we should not consume less than 1500 Calories per day for a man and not less than 1200 for a woman.

 If you under-nourish your body, your metabolism will slow down on its own thinking that something is wrong. You will obviously lose weight, but will get it back much faster because your metabolism will have learned to manage fewer calories. You will lose fat, but also muscle and as soon as you resume a normal diet, your metabolism, idling, will store extra calories faster.

This also happens with the melting of the muscle. The muscle that melts often produces fat. It is not directly related to the melting of the muscle, but to the metabolism that does not know who to give the amount of energy consumed by this muscle before. Know that muscle mass is energy consuming, even at rest.

It seems that the metabolism naturally drops by 2% per decade, after 40 years. This decrease is always due to the decrease of activity and therefore of the muscle. There was also an 8% increase in metabolism in people over 65 who were practicing bodybuilding.

It seems obvious that bodybuilding can help you significantly increase your metabolism. Of course, it is not a question of doing excessive weight training, but of working your muscles gently and finely.

<h3>Depression and anxiety: exercise relieves symptoms</h3>
<p>
    When you're depressed or anxious, it may feel like exercise is the last thing you think about, but once you find enough encouragement, you can make a huge leap.Exercising helps prevent and improve a number of health problems, including high blood pressure, diabetes and arthritis. Research on depression and stress and their relationship to exercise shows that the psychological and physical benefits of exercise can help improve mood and reduce anxiety.
    Although the links between depression, anxiety and exercise aren't entirely clear, exercise and other forms of physical activity can help relieve symptoms of depression or anxiety and make you feel better. Exercising also helps prevent depression and anxiety from returning after you feel better.
